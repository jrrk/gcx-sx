=====================================
Building and running gcx

To build the program, do a:
  ./configure ; make 
Check the INSTALL file for build options. To install, become root, then run:
  make install
You can then run the program:
  gcx

To create an initial configuration file (~/.gcxrc), run the program, then
select File->Edit Options, then Save. Options can be edited from inside the
Edit Options dialog, or directly in .gcxrc.

The manual is distributed as a latex file, and already built into a pdf and 
dvi. To rebuild it, cd to docs, then do make/make dvi/make pdf. make pdf requires
pdflatex. The manual is pretty much work-in-progress, don't expect much ;-). 

=====================================
Catalogs

The gsc catalog is available for download from 
ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cats/I/220/

The path to gcx should be set in the config file.

gcx can read edb catalogs (fixed objects only). Currently, it looks
for Messier.edb, NGC.edb, UGC.edb, YBS.edb and gcvs.edb. 
The environment variable CX_EDB_DIR should point to a directory containing 
the above files.

=====================================
Controlling cameras

gcx uses a separate camera control process, which can run on the same computer,
or somewhere on the network. For cpx3m cameras, the camera control server is 
cpxctrl. 

=====================================
Controlling a telescope

gcx can control a telescope using the LX200 protocol. It must have read-write
access to a serial port (default: /dev/ttyS0) to do that.
