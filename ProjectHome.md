As far as I know this is the only open source project to support Starlight Express CCD Cameras under Linux. Whats more, the use of libusb means no pesky debugging of device drivers.

At the moment I only have one camera to develop with (the SXV-M25c) and since there is scant chance anybody will lend me any others, I welcome any support from others with unix C programming skills, to develop the support for other models.
